The System Reference Document organization means to be diverse set of table top role playing game entusiests and creators who believe in the power of a strong community to grow the opportunity for all of us. We believe in sharing the content from our writers desks as well as our game tables. We welcome creators everywhere to build and distribute new SRDs in in a community driven process, or to just distribute something you've created.

This is an open source, community driven project dedicated to creating "open" as opposed to "closed" table top role playing games (TTRPG). This community has several distinct goals:

1. Create a centralized repository where SRDs for any popular game can be uploaded, or developed in a community driven manner
2. Create an open source community to evolve the 5e rules under the Creative Commons 4.0 license which they're released 
3. With participation from major vendors, become the canonical source for these rules, and a keel for the community
4. Preserve previously released Open Gaming content Standard Reference Documents (3, 3.5, 5, et. al.)
5. reserve the spirit of table top gaming and allow everyone to participate and contribue.
