This is an open source, community driven project dedicated to creating an open ecosystem of table top role playing games (TTRPG). This community has two distinct and primary goals:

1. Preserve previously released Open Gaming content Standard Reference Documents (3, 3.5, 5, et. al.)
2. Create an open source, community driven set of rules which are compatible with 5e
3. Create a centralized repository where SRDs for any popular game can be uploaded, or developed in a community driven manner

This should preserve the spirit of table top gaming and allow everyone to participate and contribue.
